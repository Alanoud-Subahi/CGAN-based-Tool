# CGAN-based-Tool
We developed a tool to assist researchers in the field of IoT network traffic. The CGAN model was integral in creating this tool, called the CGAN-based tool, as it provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing real-world datasets related to network security.
The tool is based on a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) and is used to create balanced datasets for studying different network attack scenarios.
